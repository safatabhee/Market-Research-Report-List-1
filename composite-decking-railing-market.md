<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Decking & Railing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped Composites</li><li>Uncapped Composites</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite decking and railing markets are primarily divided into two types: capped composites and uncapped composites. Capped composites feature a protective layer that shields the core material from moisture, UV rays, and stains, enhancing durability and aesthetics. Uncapped composites lack this outer shell, making them more susceptible to weathering and wear but often more affordable. Both types offer a blend of wood and plastic, providing sustainable, low-maintenance alternatives to traditional wood materials for outdoor spaces.</p></p>
